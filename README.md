Sample Flask app for Getting Started with Travis CI Course at Pluralsight

This app is a simple nlp-based question-answering with web interface, based on https://sweetcode.io/flask-app-github-travis-heroku/, and extended on the travis side to test in parallel multiple OS, multiple versions and have multiple types of deployment.

For each module in the course just run 

`git checkout module2` or `git checkout module4-demo1` and you will be at the point of the recording.
